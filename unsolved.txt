You must create a function that can read matrix of numbers stored in an array which will be a 2D matrix that contains only the integers 1, 0, or 2. Then from the position in the matrix where a 1 is, return the number of spaces either left, right, down, or up you must move to reach an enemy which is represented by a 2
You are able to wrap around one side of the matrix to the other. For example if array is [“0000”, “1000”, “0002”, “0002”] then this is the board
For this board your program should return 2 because the closest enemy (2) is 2 spaces away from the 1 by moving left to wrap to the other side and then moving down once. The array will contain any number of 0’s and 2’s, but only a single 1. It may not contain any 2’s at all as well, where in that case your program should return a 0.
Input: [“000”, “100”, “200”] | Output: 1
Input: [“0000”, “2010”, “0000”, “2002” ] | Output: 2


Vowel Square Have the function VowelSquare(strArr) take the strArr parameter being passed which will be a 2D matrix of some arbitrary size filled with letters from the alphabet, and determine if a 2x2 square composed entirely of vowels exists in the matrix. For example: strArr is ["abcd", "eikr", "oufj"] then this matrix looks like the following:
a b c d

e i k r

o u f j
Within this matrix there is a 2x2 square of vowels starting in the second row and first column, namely, ei, ou. If a 2x2 square of vowels is found your program should return the top-left position (row-column) of the square, so for this example your program should return 1-0. If no 2x2 square of vowels exists, then return the string not found. If there are multiple squares of vowels, return the one that is at the most top-left position in the whole matrix. The input matrix will at least be of size 2x2.

Examples:

Input: ["aqrst", "ukaei", "ffooo"]
Output: 1-2,
Input: ["gg", "ff"]
Output: not found



'''You want to create a method that receives a hand of 5 cards and returns the best poker hand you can make with those cards


For simplification, we’ll assume cards have a number and a symbol. Numbers go from 1 to 10 and symbols are ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’ and ‘d’.

To start off, assume there are only 3 types of poker hands, from better to worse. 
Take into consideration you will have to add the other ones later.

Flush: 5 cards of the same symbol. Example: 10a 4a 2a 7a 9a
Three of a Kind: 3 cards with the same number. Example: 4a 3b 1c 4d 4b
Pair: Two cards with the same number. Example: 3a 2b 8d 1a 8c

Return the best poker hand you have. For example. If you have a pair, return “Pair” or any structure that symbolizes you have a pair.
If you have a three of a kind, return “Three of a Kind” or any structure that represents it.
