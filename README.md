# Purpose
A series of random algorithm challenges found online and solved to expand skills and publicly prove the skills I have. 

My nlp project 311 challenge is a better example of a technical challenge. 

My linkedIn profile, is again another more convincing list of my technical skills; including certifications and coding tests.

# Challenges

Note: The challenges listed in this description are likely a subset of all those solved in this repo. I don't update this README super often because I don't see the point in catalogging everything. Documentation is worth while only when it provides value.  

## Free Algorithm Challenges

[Interview Kickstart](https://www.interviewkickstart.com/problems)

## Rock paper scissors 
game with optional adaptation of nuke, cockroach, shoe

A recruiter asked for it, so here it is. 

## Mutual_information
write the mutual information algorithm

### Testing
Use the mutual information algorithm that already exists in scikit learn

### Result
runs slower, but works fine. good enough for now

## Stock
data science challenge about the stock exchange

### Description

#### Task 1
create a dataframe for each company that contains the row of data for one day each year that has the highest trading volume information.
one-to-one of year-to-row

#### Task 2
create a dataframe for each company that contains the rows of data with the highest closing price for each year. If the highest closing price is $100, and that price is the close twice in the same year, then both records will be saved. 
one-to-many of year-to-row

### Data
* Several csv files.
* One file for each company.
* every day has one row with: volume, date, high, low, close, open

## Syntax
going through python syntax for validation

### Contains
* in depth examples of python 'private/protected variables'
* decorators
* python 'overloading' functions
* type annotation
* context manager
* protected keyword variable assignments
* python memory address lookup
### Notes
* bytecode can be run with a python interpreter but cannot be read easily by human eyes
* python doesn't have private or protected variables, but you can pretend
